              I'm a senior in my last semester here at Lehman college interested in venturing into either backend work...or Machine 
              Learning or some sort of AI. I say this because the programming classes I enjoyed most were my databases and AI classes.
              In my AI class I learned python and was able to create logistic regression models to predict Titanic survivors and 
              build neural networks to process and classify images. I included my github on the 
              index, or "home" page to showcase some of projects. Here are the languages I've learned along the way at Lehman:
              <ul class='middle-text'>
                  <li>Python & Jupyter Notebooks on GoogleColab</li>
                  <li>Lots & lots of Java (on Eclipse....I don't really like intelliJ)</li>
                  <li>Some more Java...on Android Studio</li>
                  <li>mySQL on Workbench (I love working on the backend more than frontend)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
              </td>
          </tr>
       </table>

        An engineer to me is a problem solver. They don't just look for a simple solution or quick fix to a problem.
        I feel like there's lots of design that goes into engineering solutions in a technical environment. I say this
        because the solutions we implement have to be supported by different languages and technologies, as well as 
        maintained by other future engineers. I also mention design because despite how complex whatever we create is, it will
        also be extremely delicate. One typo or one tiny bug on a device can completely change our system or solution.
